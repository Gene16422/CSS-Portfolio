# Advanced CSS Portfolio Drill

This exercise was to demonstrate CSS and HTML skills learned during the first week of class.
To be honest this was very challenging for me and is a task I will be continuously workinh 
with my tutor.

Eventually I want this site to accurately porttray my work in this bootcamp
